# ENT Consultation Package (Single Scan, April 18, 2025)

Patient: 19420531  
Scan date: 2025-04-18  
Context: Post-steroid, clinically clear; imaging reveals structural/chronic pathology

---

## 1) Executive Summary

- Complete bilateral OMC obstruction (0% patency left/right)
- Severe chronic osteitis: 45.5% sclerotic sinus wall bone (normal <5%)
- Numerous retention cysts: 30 lesions (persistent mucous stasis)
- Nasopharyngeal obstruction: ~88% tissue; airway ~0% patent

These findings persist despite symptom resolution after steroids and indicate structural disease predisposition to recurrence. They support FESS consideration and allergy/immunology workup.

## 2) Evidence at a Glance

- OMC overlays (both series): `docs/omc_overlay_comparison.png`
- Clinical analysis (series 5309): `docs/clinical_5309.png`
- Literature comparison chart: `docs/literature_comparison.png`
- Interactive 3D model (series 5309): `docs/3d_model_5309.html`
- Series comparison summary: `docs/SERIES_COMPARISON_SUMMARY.md`

Key metrics (series 5309 vs normal):
- OMC patency: 0% left / 0% right (normal 60-100%)
- Sclerotic bone: 45.5% (normal 0-5%)
- Retention cysts: 30 (normal 0-2)

## 3) Representative Images

- docs/omc_overlay_comparison.png
  - Shows bilateral OMC ROIs filled with tissue (0% air) across two series
- docs/clinical_5309.png
  - Key slices with soft-tissue-in-air overlays and summary tables
- docs/3d_model_5309.html
  - Interactive iso-surface (HU=-300) of sinonasal air cavities

---

## 4) Clinical Interpretation

- The bilateral OMC obstruction is structural and explains recurrent/ongoing risk even when symptoms abate.
- The high sclerotic fraction (45.5%) strongly suggests chronic inflammation over months; this is a high outlier vs literature norms.
- Numerous retention cysts indicate persistent mucous stasis.
- Nasopharyngeal tissue predominance suggests an airway contributor (adenoid hypertrophy or related mucosal thickening) that may exacerbate sinonasal disease.

## 5) Recommendations to Discuss

1. FESS (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery)
   - Target: bilateral OMC widening and addressing anatomic obstruction
   - Rationale: 0% patency; chronic osteitic change; cyst burden

2. Allergy/Immunology Evaluation
   - Clarify triggers for chronic inflammation; consider immunotherapy

3. Long-term Medical Management
   - Daily intranasal steroid; twice-daily saline; environmental control

4. Follow-up Plan
   - Imaging at 3–6 months post-intervention to quantify improvement vs this baseline

## 7) Talk Track for the Appointment

- "These are the drainage pathways (OMC). Mine are completely obstructed on both sides—0% open—even after steroids."
- "The bone around the sinuses shows chronic changes—about 45%. Normal is under 5%."
- "There are many retention cysts—30 in total—showing persistent mucous stasis."
- "Given these structural findings, I’d like to discuss FESS to address the obstruction, and an allergy workup for the chronic inflammation."
